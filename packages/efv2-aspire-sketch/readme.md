## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Ensure you have [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) installed. Then run the following command in the root directory to install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Step 2: Build the Project and Dependencies

Build the project along with all its dependencies using:

```bash
pnpm --filter efv2-aspire-sketch... build
```

### Step 3: Change Directory to the Package

Navigate to the `efv2-aspire-sketch` package directory:

```bash
cd packages/efv2-aspire-sketch
```

### Step 4: Emit the Sample Spec

Generate the sample specification by running:

```bash
pnpm build-todo
```

This command will emit the sample spec to the `packages/efv2-aspire-sketch/sample` directory.

### Step 5: Verify the Output

After the spec is emitted, you can find the generated code under:

```
packages/efv2-aspire-sketch/sample/output
```
